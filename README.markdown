This project is a simple exercise to upload images via an ASP.NET MVC 3 site. It mostly follows guidance from Steven Sanderson's "Pro ASP.NET MVC 2 Framework" but is using MVC 3 and Razor. 

This is not intended to be a fully-polished application, with robust exception handling, instrumentation, security, etc. However, it does represent my current thoughts on software development.
